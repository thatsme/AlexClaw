# AlexClaw Architecture

A BEAM-native personal autonomous AI agent built on Elixir/OTP.

---

## Overview

AlexClaw monitors the world (RSS feeds, web sources, GitHub repositories, Google services, APIs), accumulates knowledge in PostgreSQL, executes workflows autonomously on schedule, and communicates with its owner via Telegram. Every task is routed to the cheapest available LLM that satisfies the required reasoning tier — including fully local models.

**Design principles:**
- **BEAM-native** — supervision, concurrency, and fault tolerance are the runtime, not bolted on
- **Single-user** — one operator, one codebase, fully auditable. Not a platform
- **Cost-aware** — multi-model LLM router maximizes free tiers across providers
- **Runtime-configurable** — all settings live in PostgreSQL, cached in ETS, editable via admin UI without restart

All async work (workflow execution, GitHub reviews, background tasks) runs under `AlexClaw.TaskSupervisor` — crashes are reported and supervised, not silently lost.

---

## Core Components

### Gateway — `AlexClaw.Gateway`

GenServer that long-polls the Telegram Bot API. Normalizes inbound updates into `%Message{}` structs and passes them to the Dispatcher. Outbound messages go through `Gateway.send_message/2` which calls the Telegram `sendMessage` API with Markdown parsing.

### Dispatcher — `AlexClaw.Dispatcher`

Deterministic pattern-matching router. No LLM involved in routing — zero token cost for dispatch. Maps Telegram commands to skills:

```
/ping              → pong
/status            → system stats (uptime, memory, active skills)
/skills            → list from SkillRegistry
/llm               → provider status and usage
/workflows         → list all workflows with status/schedule
/run <id|name>     → execute a workflow on demand (supports 2FA gating)
/research <q>      → Research skill
/search <q>        → WebSearch skill
/web <url> [q]     → WebBrowse skill
/github pr <r> [n] → GitHubSecurityReview — review PR
/github commit <r> <sha> → GitHubSecurityReview — review commit
/record <url>      → WebAutomation — start browser recording
/record stop <sid> → WebAutomation — stop recording, save as resource
/replay <id>       → WebAutomation — replay a saved automation
/automate <url>    → WebAutomation — headless scrape/screenshot
/tasks             → Google Tasks — list tasks
/task add <title>  → Google Tasks — create a task
/tasklists         → Google Tasks — list task lists
/connect google    → Google OAuth — initiate authorization flow
/setup 2fa         → TOTP — generate secret and QR code
/confirm 2fa <code>→ TOTP — confirm 2FA setup
/disable 2fa       → TOTP — disable 2FA
/help              → command list
<free text>        → Conversational skill (LLM fallback)
```

### Skill Supervisor — `AlexClaw.SkillSupervisor`

DynamicSupervisor. Each skill execution runs as an isolated OTP process. Crashes are contained — a failed RSS fetch does not affect a concurrent research query.

### LLM Router — `AlexClaw.LLM`

Every LLM call declares a tier requirement. The router queries the `llm_providers` table for enabled providers matching that tier, ordered by `priority` (lower = preferred). If no provider is available for the requested tier, it falls back to the `local` tier.

All providers — cloud and local — are stored in PostgreSQL with type (`openai_compatible`, `ollama`, `gemini`, `anthropic`, `custom`), tier assignment, priority, and optional daily limits. Default providers (Gemini Flash/Pro, Claude Haiku/Sonnet/Opus, Ollama, LM Studio) are seeded on first boot by `ProviderSeeder`. Additional providers can be added, removed, or reconfigured from the admin UI at runtime.

Usage counters are keyed by `{provider_id, Date.utc_today()}` in ETS and persisted to the `llm_usage` table so counts survive restarts.

**Embedding support:** `LLM.embed/2` generates 768-dimension vectors for semantic memory search. Provider resolution is separate from the completion tier system — configured via `embedding.provider` (or auto-detected: Gemini → Ollama → OpenAI-compatible). Each provider type has a dedicated response parser (Gemini `embedContent`, Ollama `/api/embed`, OpenAI `/v1/embeddings`). Embedding calls are tracked in the same usage counters as completions.

### Memory — `AlexClaw.Memory`

PostgreSQL + pgvector knowledge store. Schema:

- `kind` — `fact`, `summary`, `news_item`, `conversation`, `security_review`, `web_search`, `web_page`
- `content` — the stored text
- `source` — URL, feed name, skill name
- `embedding` — pgvector column (768 dimensions, HNSW index with cosine distance)
- `metadata` — JSONB
- `expires_at` — optional TTL

**Async embedding:** `Memory.store/3` inserts the row immediately with a nil embedding, then fires a background task under `TaskSupervisor` to generate the vector via `LLM.embed/2` and update the row. This keeps skill execution non-blocking.

**Hybrid search:** `Memory.search/2` runs both vector similarity and keyword (ILIKE) queries in parallel, merges results with `Enum.uniq_by/2` (vector results first), and returns the top N. Falls back to keyword-only when no embedding provider is available.

**Embedding providers:** `LLM.embed/2` resolves a provider via `embedding.provider` config (or auto-detects: Gemini → Ollama → OpenAI-compatible). Supports Gemini `text-embedding-004` (free tier), Ollama `/api/embed`, and any OpenAI-compatible `/v1/embeddings` endpoint.

**Re-embedding:** `Memory.reembed_all/1` batch-processes all entries with nil embeddings in the background using `Task.async_stream` with configurable concurrency. Used when switching embedding models.

Deduplication by URL/content via `Memory.exists?/1`.

### Identity — `AlexClaw.Identity`

Builds the system prompt injected into every LLM call. All strings come from `AlexClaw.Config` — zero hardcoded persona text. Supports per-skill context fragments via config keys like `prompts.context.rss_collector`.

### Config — `AlexClaw.Config`

Runtime configuration system. On boot, `Config.Loader` seeds default values from environment variables into PostgreSQL. After that, all changes are made through the admin UI. Values are cached in an ETS table for fast reads. Changes are broadcast via Phoenix PubSub so all processes see updates immediately. No restart required.

Sensitive values (API keys, tokens, OAuth secrets) are encrypted at the application level using AES-256-GCM before storage. The encryption key is derived from `SECRET_KEY_BASE` via HKDF-SHA256 and cached in `:persistent_term`. Each value gets a unique random IV. On boot, `EncryptExisting` idempotently encrypts any plaintext sensitive values, then `Config.init()` reloads ETS with decrypted values. The `sensitive` boolean flag on each setting controls encryption behavior.

Categories: `identity`, `llm`, `embedding`, `telegram`, `skills`, `github`, `google`, `auth`, `prompts`, `web_automator`.

### LogBuffer — `AlexClaw.LogBuffer`

In-memory ring buffer (500 entries max) attached to the Erlang Logger. Classifies log entries by severity (`critical`, `high`, `moderate`, `low`) using pattern matching on log level and message content. Filters out verbose OTP/Ecto noise. Exposes `recent/1` for filtered retrieval and `counts/0` for severity aggregates. Powers the real-time log viewer in the admin UI.

### Rate Limiter — `AlexClaw.RateLimiter`

ETS-based login rate limiting. Tracks failed attempts per IP. After a configurable number of failures (default 5), blocks the IP for a configurable duration (default 15 minutes). A GenServer runs a periodic purge cycle to clean expired entries. All limits are adjustable at runtime via Config UI.

---

## Authentication & Security

### Admin UI Authentication

Session-based cookie authentication. All routes except `/login` require an authenticated session via the `RequireAuth` plug. Password is set via the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable. Login rate limiting is enforced by the `RateLimit` plug on `POST /login`.

### 2FA / TOTP — `AlexClaw.Auth.TOTP`

Optional TOTP-based two-factor authentication for sensitive operations. Setup flow via Telegram:

1. `/setup 2fa` — generates secret, sends QR code image and manual key
2. User scans QR with Google Authenticator (or compatible app)
3. `/confirm 2fa <code>` — verifies first code, enables 2FA

Once enabled, workflows with `requires_2fa: true` in their metadata trigger a challenge before execution. Challenges expire after 2 minutes. Secrets and state are stored in ETS with the TOTP secret persisted in Config.

### GitHub Webhooks

`POST /webhooks/github` with HMAC-SHA256 signature verification. The `CachingBodyReader` plug caches the raw request body before JSON parsing so the HMAC is verified against the original payload, not re-serialized JSON. Push events on watched branches trigger automatic security reviews.

---

## Google Integration

### OAuth Flow — `AlexClaw.Google.OAuth`

1. User sends `/connect google` via Telegram
2. Gateway generates an auth URL with a random state token linked to their chat_id (expires in 10 minutes)
3. User taps the link, authorizes in Google's consent screen
4. Google redirects to `/auth/google/callback` with code + state
5. `OAuthCallbackController` exchanges the code for tokens
6. Refresh token stored in Config, access token cached in `Google.TokenManager`

Scopes: `calendar.readonly`, `tasks`.

### Token Manager — `AlexClaw.Google.TokenManager`

GenServer that caches the current Google access token in ETS. Automatically refreshes the token before expiry (5-minute margin). All Google API calls go through `TokenManager.get_token/0` which returns `{:ok, token}` or `{:error, reason}`.

---

## Workflow Engine

Workflows are multi-step pipelines stored in PostgreSQL. Each step specifies a skill name, a config JSON, an execution order, and optional LLM tier/provider overrides. The executor runs steps sequentially, passing each step's output as input to the next.

### Step Wiring

By default, each step receives the output of the previous step as its input. The `input_from` field enables non-linear wiring — a step can pull its input from any earlier step by specifying its order number. This allows fan-in patterns where multiple processing branches converge.

### Provider Routing

LLM provider selection can be configured at three levels (most specific wins):
1. **Step-level** — `llm_tier` and `llm_model` fields on the workflow step
2. **Workflow-level** — `default_provider` field on the workflow
3. **Global** — tier-based fallback chain in the LLM router

### Execution

- **Scheduled** — cron expressions synced to Quantum by `SchedulerSync`
- **On-demand via Telegram** — `/run <id or name>` (supports 2FA gating)
- **Admin UI** — run button on workflow and scheduler pages

All workflow executions run under `AlexClaw.TaskSupervisor`. Run history with step-level results (output, duration, success/failure) is stored in the database and visible in the admin UI.

### Notifications

When a workflow contains a `telegram_notify` step, the executor sends a start notification when the workflow begins and a failure notification if any step fails before reaching the notify step.

## Skills

Skills are Elixir modules implementing the `AlexClaw.Skill` behaviour (`description/0` and `run/1`). Registered in `AlexClaw.Workflows.SkillRegistry`.

| Skill | Module | Tier | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `rss_collector` | `RSSCollector` | light | Fetch RSS feeds, batch-score relevance via LLM, notify |
| `web_search` | `WebSearch` | medium | Search DuckDuckGo, fetch top results, synthesize answer |
| `web_browse` | `WebBrowse` | light | Fetch and summarize a URL, optionally answer questions |
| `research` | `Research` | medium | Deep research with memory context |
| `conversational` | `Conversational` | light | Free-text conversation with identity and memory |
| `telegram_notify` | `TelegramNotify` | — | Send workflow output to Telegram (markdown → HTML) |
| `llm_transform` | `LLMTransform` | configurable | Run a prompt template through the LLM |
| `api_request` | `ApiRequest` | — | Make an authenticated HTTP request with retries |
| `github_security_review` | `GitHubSecurityReview` | medium | Fetch PR/commit diff, run LLM security analysis |
| `google_calendar` | `GoogleCalendar` | — | Fetch upcoming events from Google Calendar |
| `google_tasks` | `GoogleTasks` | — | List and create Google Tasks |
| `web_automation` | `WebAutomation` | — | Browser recording and headless replay via sidecar |

Shared utilities (`parse_int`, `parse_float`, `sanitize_utf8`, `strip_noise`, `blank?`) live in `AlexClaw.Skills.Helpers`.

---

## Web Automation

Optional browser automation via a Python/Playwright sidecar (`web-automator/`).

- **Record** — start a browser session with noVNC for live interaction, captures user actions as reproducible steps
- **Replay** — headless execution of recorded steps with scraping, screenshots, downloads
- **Resources** — recordings are saved as resources (type: `automation`) with step metadata in JSONB

The sidecar runs as a separate container in docker-compose with Xvfb + noVNC. Enable via `web_automator.enabled` config. Dispatcher commands: `/record`, `/record stop`, `/replay`, `/automate`.

---

## GitHub Security Review

Reviews pull requests and commits for security issues:

- Fetches diff via GitHub API (supports fine-grained tokens per workflow)
- Truncates diff at 24KB for local model compatibility
- LLM produces structured output: RISK LEVEL, FINDINGS, SUMMARY, RECOMMENDATION
- Results stored in Memory (kind: `security_review`)
- Webhook endpoint at `/webhooks/github` with HMAC-SHA256 signature verification via `CachingBodyReader`
- Telegram trigger: `/github pr owner/repo 42` or `/github commit owner/repo <sha>`
- Automatic review on push events to watched branches (configurable)

---

## Resources — `AlexClaw.Resources`

Shared data objects that workflows can reference. Stored in PostgreSQL.

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| `rss_feed` | RSS feed URL with name and enabled flag |
| `website` | URL for web browsing/scraping |
| `document` | Inline text content |
| `api` | API endpoint with auth metadata |
| `automation` | Recorded browser automation with step metadata |

Resources can be assigned to workflows. Skills access them via `args[:resources]` in `run/1`. The feeds management page is a convenience wrapper around resources filtered by type `rss_feed`.

---

## Web Interface

Phoenix LiveView admin UI. Session-based authentication — all routes except `/login` require an authenticated session. No JavaScript hooks — fully server-rendered.

| Page | Route | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Dashboard | `/` | System uptime, memory, LLM usage, Google status, recent activity |
| Workflows | `/workflows` | Create/edit/run pipelines, step editor, resource assignment |
